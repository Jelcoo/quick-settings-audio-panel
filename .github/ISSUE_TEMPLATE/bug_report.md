**DOT NOT OPEN BUG REPORTS FOR GNOME 44 OR LOWER**, those versions aren't supported anymore

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Compatibility**
Does this issue arise when all other extensions are disabled ?
If so, which extension(s) are causing the issue ?

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS (distribution): [e.g. Ubuntu 24.04]
 - Gnome shell version: (if you don't know, use `gnome-shell --version`)

**Logs**
Get the logs, by either:
- running this command: `journalctl -f -o cat /usr/bin/gnome-shell`, triggering the issue, then copying the output of the command
- executing this command after the issue has been triggered: `journalctl /usr/bin/gnome-shell | cat`. Logs are much longer this way, so only use this method if you can't use the first one.

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
